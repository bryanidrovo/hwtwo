					<p>New York City has changed drastically in the last decade. More people are moving here than ever, which means the NYC lifestyle also has to change. One of the biggest and most damaging changes to the city has been gentrification. Gentrification is when a low-income neighborhood/area changes due to wealthier people moving in. These changes include; higher rent, more conglomerate presence, newer more expensive businesses, and so much more. Gentrification is not a new thing though, it’s been happening for years, and that’s exactly what I, Bryan Idrovo will be exploring in this interactive website.</p>
					<p>I used to live in Sunnyside, Queens, I grew up in a six family, rent-stabilized building for pretty much my whole life. However in 2019, my life completely changed. Our landlord was evicting us out of our home with no explanation whatsoever. I was confused and scared, never in my life would I have even considered moving out of Sunnyside, but it wasn’t until I moved to Kew Gardens when I realized that our old landlord wanted us gone to completely renovate the apartment, and charge double the price in rent. The most my parents paid in rent in Sunnyside was $1,400, which is extremely low for the area. Sunnyside is now one of the most sought after neighborhoods in Queens due to its proximity to Manhattan, and variety of local and nationwide businesses. Because of the influx in interest in Sunnyside, rent skyrocketed over the last 2-3 years, which is why my old landlord listed my childhood home at a whopping $3,000 a month. As a victim of gentrification I understand the pain and feeling of hopelessness that so many New Yorkers feel, which is why I chose this topic to discuss/explore.</p>
