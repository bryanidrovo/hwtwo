						<p>Queens is an enormous part of New York City, and it’s often forgotten about when discussing NYC in general. I’m a Queens native, I was born and raised in Sunnyside, then moved to Kew Gardens, then moved to Woodside, so I have had my fair share of the Queens experience. This is exactly why I chose to specifically talk about the gentrification in Queens, because I have seen it happen with my own eyes. I’ll start off with a neighborhood that I would (and still) visit often; Jackson Heights. My primary hospital is located in Jackson Heights, and it’s only one of two major hospitals in Queens (which is a conversation for another time). I was born in Elmhurst Hospital, and when I was 8-12 years old I would always go with my grandmother to pick her medicine up. Years passed and I would either go eat dinner with family/friends in the area, or visit my cousins, but while the years passed I noticed the neighborhood was also changing. The local movie theater (that was around for decades) was taken down and replaced by a Target, then soon enough, the whole block was dominated by a Chick-Fil-A, SmashBurger, Starbucks, and Chipotle. If that doesn’t scream gentrification, I don’t know what will! </p>
						<p>Jackson Heights is a primarily Hispanic/immigrant neighborhood, and while Target is a great store to find all the basic daily needs, it takes business away from all the local businesses that have been around for years, plus, the local business owners form personal connections with those that are frequently shoppers, which is a point that Seonae Byeon, a Korean immigrant who grew up in Flushing, Queens makes in the article, ‘Not what it used to be’: in New York, Flushing’s Asian residents brace against gentrification. In The Guardian article, Byeon says “she regularly hears about people moving into basements and attics, or sharing a bedroom with two or three others – more rarely, eight to nine. While this is a longstanding practice there, she says the number of people who are forced to do this has been increasing rapidly because of gentrification. According to data from the department of buildings, complaints of illegal home conversions in Flushing’s community board district, where apartments are subdivided into multiple dwellings often in hazardous ways, have steadily increased since 2010”. Byeon continues to discuss the relationship between local business owners and their non-English speaking customers, “Ten years ago, Byeon would chat with Korean grandmothers selling vegetables in Downtown Flushing. The aunties aren’t there any more. In high school, she hung out with friends in Assi Plaza, an affordable Korean grocery store located in the now hotly contested waterfront. But in 2014, Assi was closed and the land sold for $55m; it was then resold multiple times until Young Nian Group bought it for $115m last year.“For an immigrant who has limited English, you are able to go to a store [in Flushing] without being terrified or scared of speaking English, because there are signs in Chinese, Korean,” she says. “If you need somebody to help you with certain things, you might have a neighbor who speaks the same language as you. If you are feeling nostalgic and want to get a certain kind of food, you can get it.” </p>
						<p>The biggest takeaway from this article is to show that gentrification is slowly diminishing the culture so many people have created. It’s more than just companies like Starbucks replacing local stores; it’s about the history behind these local delis, mom-and-pop shops, and street vendors. They are what make up New York City, and what keep this city going.</p>
